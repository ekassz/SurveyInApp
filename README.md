# SurveyInApp
### Participated in the Starbucks Hackathon with a team of 6 interns.
Our idea was that currently, a survey is sent out each week to reward customers and they can fill it out to rate their experience on a scale of 1-7. After the score is received, they get processed through an algorithm and the Starbucks store is given whatever score that is which is normally unfair because there's only a 5% response rate amongst thousands of surveys sent out.

To automate this and make it more effective, we integrated this survey into the Starbucks app itself by first adding a pop up survey similar to other apps that ask "How was your visit?" and then it's followed with the original survey as a pop up still to optionally fill out afterwards.

Tools: React-native, Figma, Miro, Python, Databricks
